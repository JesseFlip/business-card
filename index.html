                <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>I solve business problems with technology.
After a decade leading commercial operations in a $14.8M territory, I realized my real passion wasn't just driving revenue—it was building solutions that scale. So I taught myself Python, automated our sales reporting pipeline (saving 3+ hours weekly), and started treating business challenges like engineering problems.
Now I'm making the pivot official. I'm pursuing AWS Cloud Practitioner certification (exam Feb. 28th, 2026), building technical projects (jflip.netlify.app), and serving as Chair of the PyTexas Community Committee where I lead an AI Night and helped with technical community operations.
<b>What makes me different: I understand the business side deeply. I've managed cross-functional teams, presented to C-level stakeholders, and delivered solutions in complex, high-stakes environments. I just happen to solve those challenges with code now instead of spreadsheets.
<br>I'm actively seeking Solutions Engineering, Technical Account Management, or Customer Success Engineering roles where I can bridge business strategy and technical implementation.
